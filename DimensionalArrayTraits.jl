"""
Trait container for dimension and array ordering in AllignedGrid.

The default is `Ordered(Forward()`, `Forward())`

All combinations of forward and reverse order for data and indices seem to occurr
in real datasets, as strange as that seems. We cover these possibilities by specifying
the order of both explicitly.

Knowing the order of indices is important for using methods like `searchsortedfirst()`
to find indices in sorted lists of values. Knowing the order of the data is then
required to map to the actual indices. It's also used to plot the data later - which
always happens in smallest to largest order.

Base also defines Forward and Reverse, but they seem overly complicated for our purposes.

"""
Indicates wether the cell value is specific to the locus point
or is related to the whole the span.

The span may contain a value if the distance between locii if known.
This will often be identical to the distance between any two sequential
cell values, but may be distinct due to rounding errors in a vector index,
or context-dependent spans such as `Month`.
